This work presents the determination and analysis of the performance of three-phase induction motors using the steady-state equivalent circuit. Electrical parameters are obtained from predefined models in Simulink, and fundamental quantities at the nominal point, such as slip, speed, current, torque, power, and efficiency, are calculated using them. Subsequently, characteristic curves are generated as a function of slip and mechanical power, allowing for the evaluation of behavior during starting, maximum torque, and no-load operation. The study also includes an analysis of variable frequency operation, highlighting how the proportional voltage-frequency variation alters the torque-speed curves.
